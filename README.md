# Population-level consequences of inheritable somatic mutations and the evolution of mutation rates in plants

This repository contains the simulation program used in the study "Population-level consequences of inheritable somatic mutations 
and the evolution of mutation rates in plants", currently under screening to be published on BioRXiv.

_Abstract_

Inbreeding depression, that is the decrease in fitness of inbred relative to outbred individuals, was shown to increase strongly as life expectancy increases 
in plants. Because plants are thought to not have a separated germline, it was proposed that this pattern could be generated by somatic mutations accumulating 
during growth, since larger and more long-lived species have more opportunities for mutations to accumulate. A key determinant of the role of somatic mutations 
is the rate at which they occur, which likely differs between species because mutation rates may evolve differently in species with constrasting life-histories. 
In this paper, we study the evolution of the mutation rates in plants, and consider the population-level consequences of inheritable somatic mutations given 
this evolution. We show that despite substantially lower per year mutation rates, more long-lived species still tend to accumulate larger amounts of deleterious 
mutations because of higher per generation, leading to higher levels of inbreeding depression in these species. However, the magnitude of this increase depends 
strongly on how mutagenic meiosis is relative to growth.

_Files description_

All the files required for compiling and running the program are given in this repository. 
The program has to be compiled using -std=c++11 and was written on an Ubuntu 16.04/18.04 architecture. Relevant files are annotated. 
* _fichiers.cpp_ contains the functions relating to files management in general (reading parameters, managing backups...).
* _main.cpp_ is the main file of the program. It calls all the other functions used.
* _ranbin.cpp_ contains the functions we use to simulate various distributions (mostly Poisson) using a random numbers generator.
* _functions.cpp_ contains the recombination, growth and fitness calculation functions.
* _recursion.cpp_ is the most important file of this program. It contains the "recursion()" function, which performs the simulations. 
* _mt.h_ is the MersenneTwister random numbers generator.
* _header.h_ contains all the prototypes of functions and structures used in the program.
* _s_parameters.txt_ is a template for the parameters input file.
* _sauvegarde.sh_ is a shell script called upon in the C++ program to manage back-ups during simulations. It should always be in the same folder as the executable file.
